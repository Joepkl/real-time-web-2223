## Course description

During this course you will learn how to build a real-time application. You will learn techniques to setup an open connection between the client and the server. This will enable you to send data in real-time both ways, at the same time.


## Assignment

I chose to make a Trivia quiz app. This app supports multi user functionalities and is a real time application. Meaning the users are instantly updated on a data change. This makes it possible to play with multiple users against each other. 

## The API

For this project I used the https://opentdb.com/ API. This API includes questions about different topics, difficulty, true/false or multiple choice questions. For my application I decided to only use multiple choice questions about computer science.
